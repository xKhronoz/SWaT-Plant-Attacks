# pylogix

This project will allow you to easily read/write values from tags in Rockwell Automation Logix based PLC's over Ethernet I/P using Python.  PLC models inclued CompactLogix, ControlLogix and Micro8xx.  Python2 and Python3 are both supported.

This project does not support PLC5, SLC or the Micrologix controllers.

## Getting Started

There are currently no dependencies so you can get going quickly without having to install any other prerequiste packages.

### Installing

You can clone the repo with the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/dmroeder/pylogix.git
cd pylogix
python setup.py install --user
```

Or you can install with pip (Latest version):

```
pip install git+https://github.com/dmroeder/pylogix
```

To install previous version before major changes (0.3.7):

```
pip install git+https://github.com/dmroeder/pylogix@v0.3.7
```

### Verifying Installation

To verify the installation on Linux, open the terminal and use the following commands:

```
python
import pylogix
pylogix.__version__
```

### Your First Script:

The cloned repository will come with many examples, I'll give one here.  We'll read one simple tag and print out the value.  All methods will return the Response class, which contains TagName, Value and Status.

```
from pylogix import PLC
with PLC() as comm:
    comm.IPAddress = '192.168.1.9'
    ret = comm.Read('MyTagName')
    print(ret.TagName, ret.Value, ret.Status)
```

NOTE: If your PLC is in a slot other than zero (like can be done with ControLogix), then you can specify the slot with the following:

```
comm.ProcessorSlot = 2
```

NOTE: If you are working with a Micro8xx PLC, you must set the Micro800 flag since the path is different:

```
comm.Micro800 = True
```

### Other Features

Pylogix has features other than simply reading/writing.  You can see all of them in the examples, I'll also list them here

* Discover()
* GetPLCTime()
* SetPLCTime()
* GetTagList()
* GetModuleProperties(slot=0)
